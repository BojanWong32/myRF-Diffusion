# RF-Diffusion

We introduce RF-Diffusion, a versatile generative model designed for wireless data. RF-Diffusion is capable of generating various types of signals, including Wi-Fi, FMCW Radar, 5G, and even modalities beyond RF (e.g., EEG signal), showcasing RF-Diffusion's prowess across different signal categories. We extensively evaluate RF-Diffusion's generative capabilities and validate its effectiveness in multiple downstream tasks, including Wi-Fi sensing, 5G channel estimation, and EEG denoising.

Our basic implementation of RF-Diffusion is provided in this repository. We have released several medium-sized pre-trained models (each containing 16 to 32 blocks, with 128 or 256 hidden dim) and part of the corresponding data files in [releases](https://github.com/mobicom24/RF-Diffusion/releases/tag/dataset_model), which can be used for performance testing. 

An intuitive comparison between RF-Diffusion and three other prevalent generative models is shown as follows. For demonstration purposes, we provide the **Doppler Frequency Shift (DFS)** spectrogram of the Wi-Fi signal, and the **Range Doppler Map (RDM)** spectrogram of the FMCW Radar signal, which are representative features of the two signals, respectively.
Please note that all these methods generate the **raw complex-valued signals**, and the spectrograms are shown for ease of illustration.

As shown, RF-Diffusion generates signals that accurately retain their physical features.

## 0. Prerequisite

RF-Diffusion is implemented with [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [PyTorch 2.0.1](https://pytorch.org/). We manage the development environment using [Conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda).
Execute the following commands to configure the development environment.

- Create a conda environment called `RF-Diffusion` based on python 3.8, and activate the environment.
    ```bash
    conda create -n RF-Diffusion python=3.8
    conda activate RF-Diffusion 
    ```

- Install PyTorch, as well as other required packages.
    ```bash
    pip3 install torch
    ```
    ```bash
    pip3 install numpy scipy tensorboard tqdm
    ```

For more details about the environment configuration, refer to the `requirement.txt` file in [releases](https://github.com/mobicom2445/RF-Diffusion/releases/tag/dataset_model).

Download or `git clone` the `RF-Diffusion` project. Download and unzip `dataset.zip` and `model.zip` in [releases](https://github.com/mobicom24/RF-Diffusion/releases/tag/dataset_model) to the project directory.

```bash
unzip dataset.zip -d [RF-Diffusion root directory]
unzip model.zip -d [RF-Diffusion root directory]
```

The project structure is shown as follows:

## 1. RF Data Generation

In the following part, we use `task_id` to differentiate between four types of tasks of synthesising Wi-Fi, FMCW signals, performing 5G channel estimation, and denoising the EEG to 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

### 1.1 Wi-Fi Data Generation

By executing the following code, you can generate new Wi-Fi data, and the corresponding average SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure) will be displayed in the command line.

```python
python3 inference.py --task_id 0
```

The generated data are stored in `.mat` format, and can be found in `./dataset/wifi/output`.

Our model showcases the best performance in both SSIM (Structure Similarity Index Measure) and FID (Frechet Inception Distance) compared to other prevalent generative models:
<div align="center">    <img src=".\img\1-exp-overall-wifi-ssim.png"  height=230><img src=".\img\2-exp-overall-wifi-fid.png" height=230> </div>

### 1.2 FMCW Data Generation

By executing the following code, you will generate FMCW data, and the corresponding average SSIM (Structural Similarity Index measure) will be displayed in the command line.

```python
python3 inference.py --task_id 1
```

The generated data are stored in `.mat` format, and can be found at `./dataset/fmcw/output`.

Our model showcases the best performance in both SSIM (Structure Similarity Index Measure) and FID (Frechet Inception Distance) among all prevalent generative models:

## 2. Case Study

### 2.1 Augmented Wireless Sensing

A pre-trained RF-Diffusion can be leveraged as a data augmenter, which generates synthetic RF signals of the designated type. The synthetic samples are then mixed with the original dataset, collectively employed to train the wireless sensing model.
You can try performing the data generation task on your own dataset based on the instructions in [RF Data Generation](#1-rf-data-generation), and train your own model with both real-world and synthetic data.

To retrain a new model, you only need to place your own data files within the `./dataset/wifi/raw` or `./dataset/fmcw/raw` directory, and then execute the `train.py` script to retrain. You may need to properly set the `./tfdiff/params.py` file to correspond to your input data format.

Taking Wi-Fi gesture recognition as an example. We choose the Widar3.0 dataset and perform augmented wireless sensing on two models, Widar3.0 and EI, to test the performance gain of data augmentation in both cross-domain and in-domain scenarios.

### 2.2 5G FDD Channel Estimation

By executing the following command, a downlink channel estimation for 5G FDD system can be performed. 

```python
python3 inference.py --task_id 2
```

The corresponding average Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) will be displayed in the command line.

The channel estimation is evaluated based on the [Argos](https://renew.rice.edu/dataset-argos.html) dataset. As the results show, our model showcases the best performance compared to state-of-the-art models.

### 2.3 Supplementary: EEG Signal Denoise

RF-Diffusion is designed to generate a wide range of time-series data. While its primary application is in the wireless/RF signals domain, its capabilities extend beyond that.
To verify this, we provide a supplementary case study for EEG denoising, which doesn't appear in our submitted paper due to the page limitation.

To run the EEG denoising application, you only need to extract the contents of `eeg.zip` and place the extracted folder in the `model` folder. 

```bash
unzip eeg.zip -d [RF-Diffusion/model]
```

By executing the following code, RF-Diffusion can be leveraged to denoise the EEG signals which is contaminated by EOG interference. 

```python
python3 inference.py --task_id 3
```

The corresponding average Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) will be displayed in the command line. The denoised EEG data can be found at `./dataset/eeg/output`.

Our EEG denoising evaluation is tested on the [GCTNET](https://github.com/JinY97/GCTNet/tree/main/data) dataset. Compared with other denoising methods, RF-Diffusion demonstrates a delightful result.
